      I am a Computer Science undergraduate senior who just entered the field of Cybersecurity through NCSU's Concentration last year, and is loving every second of learning about it.
      
      I consider myself optimistic, friendly, adaptable, and a diligent worker. I am also a lifelong learner who enjoys the process of gaining knowledge from new experiences and working with peers in group environments.

      I am currently seeking a full-time technical position in Cybersecurity or Software Engineering for Spring 2025 and beyond. I am also open to part-time work starting immediately.
